I was in graduate school when the internet was first becoming widely used by the general public. Since I am naturally curious about how things work ([a trait I inherited from my father](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817192909/http://www.people.virginia.edu/~rjh9u/humbiol993.html), I began teaching myself about HTML and the rudiments of website design in my spare time. Eventually, I developed and published the [University of Iowa Department of Classics' first web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20000816073621/http://www.uiowa.edu/~classics/) (thanks to the [Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/) for preserving those first attempts ðŸ˜€).

Those first experiences led to my appointment as the Webmaster for the [Classical Association of the Middle West and South](https://camws.org/) (2002â€“2009). Among the other features that I implemented, I added internet commerce capabilities so that they could handle membership dues and conference registrations electronically. After that, I moved on to become the Information Architect for the [Society for Classical Studies](https://classicalstudies.org/) (2011â€“present). During these years of working for non-profit professional organizations, the standards and practices for web development underwent major changes. I went from managing a collection of static HTML pages to working with dynamic content management systems like [ExpressionEngine](https://expressionengine.com/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), along with all of their accompanying technologies (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).

Over time, my interests in teaching and scholarship coalesced with my knowledge and use of technology. I was an early adopter of digital tools and methods for enhancing the learning experience in my courses, but my first experience teaching fully online didn't occur until COVID-19 made it necessary. Although I adapted quickly to making short instructional videos and using both synchronous and asynchronous teaching methods, I discovered that I still prefer working with students in person. That doesn't mean that I will revert to teaching entirely in person. Rather, I plan to continue using technology where it is both appropriate and effective.

As for scholarship, I began working at the intersection of traditional philology and the emerging field of digital humanities. In addition to the web technology that I was already comfortable using, I learned about Natural Language Processing, Linked Open Data, text manipulation, and a variety of other ways of working with information. Before I knew it, I was working daily with not only Latin and Greek, but also XML, Python, JavaScript, and other computer languages.

All of that put me in a good position to become the director of the [Digital Latin Library](https://digitallatin.org/), a collaborative effort of the Society for Classical Studies, the Medieval Academy of America, and the Renaissance Society of America. In that capacity, I led a [team of colleagues](https://digitallatin.org/about-project/initial-dll-working-group/) to secure funding (nearly $2 million over five years) from the [Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/) to support the development of a resource for finding and publishing texts in Latin from all eras. During that period of funding, we developed a [data model for digital critical editions of Latin texts](https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html), [experimental applications for visualizing digital critical editions](https://digitallatin.org/library-digital-latin-texts/data-visualization/), the framework for a [finding aid for existing editions of Latin texts](https://catalog.digitallatin.org/), a [platform for publishing peer-reviewed digital editions](https://digitallatin.org/library-digital-latin-texts/), an [authentication system for those editions](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/4/000438/000438.html), and an [interactive reading room](https://ldlt.digitallatin.org/).
