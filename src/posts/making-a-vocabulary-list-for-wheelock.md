My colleagues and I wanted to have a table of all of the vocabulary words used in [_Wheelock's Latin_](http://www.wheelockslatin.com/) that also showed the ranking of each word in terms of usage frequency as recorded in [Dickinson College Commentaries' Latin Core Vocabulary list](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-core-list1).

I used the helpful [Google Doc of all of the vocabulary in Wheelock](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_exhKRH1rVIL2yE_dc8jLk6zPwsb-r4os-BX43k6RE/edit?usp=sharing) to get the list of words. DCC thoughtfully makes their Latin Core Vocabulary list available for free as a CSV (bene factum, DCC!). I did some preprocessing of the two sets of information to get two sets of data that I could compare. After that, I used the Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to merge the two sets. Overkill? Definitely! But it beats doing the comparison manually!

If you're curious, you can see the repository with the data and the Python script at <https://github.com/sjhuskey/latin-vocabulary>.

Here's the table. It's sorted by Frequency Rank. You can also [download it as a CSV](/files/wheelock-dcc.csv "wheelock-dcc").
