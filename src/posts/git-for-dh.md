Version control is not only for keeping track of research data and files; it is also a potential safeguard against loss of information and a vital component in making research reproducible and, if done well, understandable.

Here are some tips I have developed for myself over the years:

1. Every DH research project should employ the distributed version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for code and, in a separate repository, data.
    - Concerns about the size of the dataset and its content (e.g., whether it contains protected, private, sensitive, or proprietary information) must dictate how the dataset is tracked.
    - Use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for tracking large files (audio, video, large datasets, etc.). 
1. A `.gitignore` file should be used judiciously to prevent sensitive, protected, or proprietary knowledge from being tracked by Git and pushed to remote repositories. A useful collection of ready-made `.gitignore` files can be found at <https://github.com/github/gitignore>.
1. Exercise great caution when tracking private or sensitive information with Git. If protected data is included in even one commit, it will be discoverable if the repository is publicly sharedâ€”even if the file is removed from later commits. Never fear, though. You can use [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to, well, filter that mistake out of all commits and tags in your repo. You can also do [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8740187/git-how-to-remove-file-from-historical-commit/8741530#8741530), but it's riskier.
1. Every Git repository should have a `README.md` file that provides basic information about the project.
1. Every Git repository should have a license clearly indicating whether the content can be shared, reused, repurposed, etc. The site <https://choosealicense.com/> is a good resource for determining which license is appropriate.
1. Code repositories should include files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`) that enable other researchers to use the same software versions that were used in the original project.
1. Commit messages should be thought of as a research journal, containing consistent and clear language. The [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard is worth following.e Not to toot my own horn, but [I wrote an article on this subject](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42803-023-00076-9). Don't follow this example: <https://xkcd.com/1296/> ðŸ˜‰.
1. Milestones in the project should have annotated tags that follow an obvious system (e.g., [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)), and those tags should be pushed to the remote repository.
1. Major milestones should be [made citable](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) with a service such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
1. Each project should have a remote repository on a platform such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or ideally an institutional repository.
1. Remote repositories should be set to private if they contain any information that should not be publicly available.
